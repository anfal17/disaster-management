# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Features to Implement

### City Divisions & Relief Centers
- Each city is divided into 4 areas: North, South, East, and West, with a relief and evacuation center in each area. Volunteers can register in any of these cities.
  
### Volunteer Registration & Coordination
- Volunteers can register using their email, phone number, location (N, S, E, W), and relief center. They have a status available in their profile, which they can update to change their availability.
- The Command Center can filter available volunteers based on the location of relief centers and easily coordinate with them in disaster-affected areas. 
- This simplifies the process of finding human resources and helps in managing disaster-prone areas.
